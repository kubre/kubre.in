On the new year I wanted to do some star gazing and camping, plus I wanted to reach the on my bike. Before I planned the trip, I saw an instagram story for Bhandardara camping trip for motorcycle riding group the fees they was same what I would pay If I had to go on my own. I decided to contact the person in the post and book me and my friend joining from pune.

Before this trip started I got myself a riding jacket as I already had a helmet and gloves. I also prepared bike by cleaning and lubricating the chain using WD40 and some SAE90W oil.

On the morning of the trip I woke early at 4:30AM and got ready I had already packed my bag with toiletries and extra set of clothes. While I put on my base layer which was supposed to protect me from cold weather I got from decathlon. Then I put on my riding jacket(rynox air gt4) and helmet(SMX) and gloves(rynox). I had my bike fueled up to top last day on JIO BP petrol pump and left around 5:30AM. Entire riding group was supposed to meet at paithan gate which is about 10 mins from my home. When I reached at the spot I was already late as our meet time was 5:30AM, but after reaching I realised I'm the first one. One by one we met everyone but actually leaving the city took around 1 hour. After that due me only wearing my base layer under the riding jacket I was freezing cold. I had to ride slower around 80-90KMPH. Along the way we stopped at few places had tea and finally at shrirampur we stopped for breakfast and few other riders to join us. 

About 30-40KM after this we stopped at petrol pump when one of the other riders noticed my bike had low front tyre pressure. He asked me to stop and check it out. I checked it and found that I had a puncture, luckily the other rider had 10mm allen key and others from group helped me. Also by luck on side on petrol pump there was puncture repair shop. The guy at the shop refused to even remove the tyre but others from group insisted and helped to remove front tyre and we realised it was caused due rust on the rim. Alot of the people in riding group had same bike as me(xpulse 210) and the had already faced same issue before. At the place we fit a spare tube inside as to protect the tube outside and also to prevent it from getting punctured again. After filling it with air we continued our journey.

My friend from pune joined with me at sangamner. At night with multiple stops and after doing some sightseeing we reached camp. All the people in riding group were really friends and I had great time with them at night camp the food from the camp wasnt that great but just having fun with everyone alongside having such a great time riding my motorcycle.

Next day we packed our stuff and decided to leave, we decided to leave from another route which takes us to [Lavalwadi](https://www.google.com/maps?q=loc:19.5406556,73.6815806). After the monsoon the the ponds around the road are filled up and you get this gorgeous view of the road surrounded by mountains and hills in middle of the lake(definitely look for its ariel view videos as I dont have any). Throught the mountains without any cell network we went to Ratangad and went to small Amruteshwar mandir. After that we left and through twisty roads and beauiful view we finally connected back to main road and pretty much after that it was ride to home.
