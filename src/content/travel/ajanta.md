This trip was basically unplanned and rather a friend asked they are getting bored and I was too. So I forgot last time I went to Ajanta caves and it was fixed next day(Saturday) we will head to Ajanta.

Next day morning about 10AM I picked my friend and hit the NH 753F(Pune-Dighi) highway. I was driving and was not in hurry so taking small breaks and our time enjoying the scenery we reached Ajanta. You have to park outside and to the caves you will book ticket I think it was 25 INR per person to the caves. A bus will usually come and pick 20-30 tourists and take them to the caves. The bus ticket was 25 INR per person. Note that there is no network so make sure to carry cash with you. Also at the parking guys will insist on you buying the guide book please say no and do not pay for anything other than parking and bus ticket.

Once you reach to the cave from bus which takes about 15-20 mins, you can first have breakfast or lunch at the cafeteria available. I decided to have lunch(Veg Thali) as I had nothing that day. After stuffing myself me and my friend headed to caves there are about 30 rock cut caves with painting and it takes about 1-4 hours depending on how thoroughly you would like to go around them. Just like a museum go around caves and enjoy the paintings and rock cut sculptures and pillars.

While there rain started heavily pouring and I was stuck in middle of it, to visit each next cave you have to walk outside and during that time I was getting caught in the rain. I got wet but it was fun as Ajanta caves are situated in Sahyadri ranges (Western Ghats) so it was beautiful to view.

After that I headed back caught another bus to parking and from there with heat on drove back to city. Thing to note is most of the road is really good but there are sections which might have work going on so if you're driving in rain or night be careful as there might be no sign and you might meet and accident which I barely avoided colliding with piled up dirt middle of the road.
