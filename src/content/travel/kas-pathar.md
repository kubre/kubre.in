I was just going on my way scrolling on instagram then I saw some reels with entire plateau filled with flowers and got my attention. I decided to visit the place. Although it took weeks before I actually start with it.

Before week I planned my trip, planning the route I realized it would be a lot to go directly from Aurangabad to Kas Pathar directly as I have not done that much on my bike before. So I decided I would take a detour on first day to pune which is about 5 hours away, this way I could get some rest at my friend's place and also meet him.

I finished my work early on 10 Oct and at 3PM left from home. The road to Pune from Aurangabad was really bad from Shani Shingnapur the road till Ahemadnagar gets really bad with potholes about feet deep sometimes and you would have normal traffic consisting of trucks and cars traveling to Pune. This made the part take longer than expected. After that on the mountain pass before Ahemadnagar due to heavy traffic I had to haul my large and heavy bike for half an hour. Then I received a call from my friend who has left to from Pune to come home. We decided to meet at Supe(Pune). He took more time than I realized and at here I ended up wasting hour and half pretty much doing nothing. Finally I left Supe at 9:30PM or something and headed to Dange Chowk to my friend's place. Once I reached I had some food and slept.

Next morning at 9AM I left for Kas Pathar from Dange chowk. Luckily entire route is Mumbai-Satara Highway. Entire ride was smooth till I joined mountains which goes to plateau and on it was one of the most beautiful views I was able to see. Once I reached Kas Pathar I had to park my bike down and use one of the buses as you can't drive to the plateau. On the top you're also restricted as they have installed fences around pre defined path around flowers to protect them and at the end of it there is small opening you can click photos and view around.

Coming back from it on the mountain it was really pretty at time of sunset and I reached back to pune same day I also went to german bakery in pune and the brownie with ice cream, First time I had food which was hot and cold at same time. Next day I was extremely tired from entire ride and pretty much rested and had food. I left at 5PM from Dange chowk but due to heavy sunday traffic in Pune I reached Wagholi(last part of pune) at 6:30PM I was tired so decided to chill at the shell petrol pump with some coffee and banana bread and left from there at 7PM. I was already late but again at Ahemadnagar I met same friend from early as he was coming back from home to Pune. We had dinner and around 11PM I left. Before leaving my Friend(Anand) warned me to not stop anywhere in the mountain pass as it was risky. So I did the same only stopping after it and even then near hotels along the road with people near it. But it was already late and somewhere 40KM before home I was really cold as I did not have jacket and decided to stop by a closed petrol pump. There was one guy sleeping on the concrete I ignored him and checked my phone for how much time till I reach home and also play some songs. Out of nowhere a guy on motorcycle comes and stop in front of me from behind I was in shock but then I put my phone back into my pocket while the guy looked at me but then looked at the guy sleeping on concrete floor and was going near him. I started the bike and left. This was really scary experience for me cause I was in middle of nowhere and didn't knew what intentions this guy had or he might be carrying weapon. After that I did not slow my bike and once I reached city went straight to home around 1:15AM in the middle of the night. I parked my bike pretty much went to sleep.

Overall three days went really well got to meet my friends and rode my bike about 1000KM.
