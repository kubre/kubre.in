## ðŸ¤” Why make a game when you're a Web Dev? and Inspiration

I just wanted to make a game. That's it! In depth when I was kid we had this Samsung CRT TV. Nothing special about but it had this embedded game of popping balloons. It was really bare bone had nothing other than moving circles and popping them. But I loved that interactive experience so much. This got me introduced to video games. After that I played many games and since school I always wanted to make one myself. This was the original reason even why I decided to study Computer Science.

Other than personal nostalgia and motivation it's just great Idea to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. If you're custom to certain flow and knowledge you're not challenging yourself enough. Working on game you get to enter this new domain of unknown challenges and problems. It's a great way to test yourself whether you've grown as a problem solver or you've been merely remembering things. Coding practices to problems would change but the the core skills of your ability to solve complex problems by breaking them down to smaller ones and then solving them would remain same.
